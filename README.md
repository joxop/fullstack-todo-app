<h2>Please give the server some time to spinup</h2>
<h3>Thank you</h3>


This project I created a fullstack Todo app using vanilla Javascript, Express and MongoDb. 
This was an important app as It was the first App I used that tied most of my knowledge into a single application.
I felt very comfortable with my frontend skills creating a responsive app. I had a little trouble setting up my backend express server with Mongodb.
after some googling, and tinkering, I realized I forgot to setup my Schema, after properly configuring my Schema, I realized I was able to upload and save data to my database.
being able to mark task complete was easily added with some css. 
I also realized Mongodb makes it very easy to create a server, add and edit data to the database.
As simple as this project may seem, I feel I have learned alot in the sense of tying what I learned between backend and frontend development.
